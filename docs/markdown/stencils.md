# Stencil Process

Through ordering multiple revisions of the PCBs, we have needed to make revised stencils. Each time, an optimization has been made to more effectively use solder paste to place SMD components using any form of soldering (reflow oven, hot air, standard).

1. Print only Layer Dimension and Layer tCream to PDF from Fusion 360.
2. Open in Inkscape to save as SVG.
3. In Inkscape, take the legs of our LED Driver chips and scale their pitched dimension by 25 percent (the short dimension of the pad). Make sure to select Apply to each object separately.
4. Add a box of a chosen size around the whole unit. For ease, make sure the PCB cutout items are aligned to the center of the page in both directions as a group.
5. Save as an SVG and take to the computer that connects to the laser cutter.
6. Use Inkscape on the computer to save as PDF (not print to PDF).
7. Print from Adobe to the Full Spectrum Engineering Driver to the Engrave software.
8. Use the following settings: 12% Vector Current, 60% power for the fine pitch items, 100% for the border you drew earlier, and 100% speed and 1 pass for everything.
9. Get a piece of mylar from Erik or get your own PET sheets. These settings were optimized for 4 mil thick sheets.
10. Follow the Pre-Flight checklist and align your material on the bed of the laser cutter.
11. Cut and you should have a stencil that gives good results

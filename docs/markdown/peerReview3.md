# Peer Review Preparation Checklist
- [ ] Ground planes on top and bottom
- [ ] All silkscreen part labels (in tName layer) do not overlap anything
- [ ] Every part is labeled (resistance, capacitance, pin connection, etc.) (in tName or bName layer) (JLC recommends 40mil as smallest)
- [ ] Identifier label for which board and which version
- [ ] JLC-PCB DRC has been run, no remaining errors or warnings [DRU File](https://github.com/JLCPCB/jlcpcb-eagle/blob/master/design%20rules/jlcpcb-2layers.dru)
